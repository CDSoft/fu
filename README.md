Fedora Updater

[Fedora Updater] is a set of scripts to complete the Fedora installation
for my personal and professional needs.
It can be in some way tuned for other situations.

It configures a fresh minimal Fedora installation with I3,
some programming languages and a few other things...

**Caution**: make backups, read carefully and understand the source code before running this script.
You have been warned ;-)
